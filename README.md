# Data Analysis with SQL

For the first data:
We have attempted data cleaning using SQL on Nashville Housing dataset

We loaded the data as excel files and then run variour queries, based on business understanding to extract/add the necessary features like 
1. Updating the date column to its correct format, 
2. Populate null values, by joining with other table, 
3. String functions, like removing delimeters from addresses
4. Splitting the same to identify state, cities, and 
5. Split owner address using function PARSENAME, identifying as city, state
6. Standardized the column SoldAsVacant, to Yes or No
7. Select and delete duplicate values from the data
8. Drop some un-necessary columns like Tax District, SaleDate, etc



Using the covid report from its central repository to draw insights using SQL and then usng Tableau Public to draw in some visualizations
